# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Proposing two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table involves considering how to handle changes to customer addresses over time. Type 1 and Type 2 are classifications used in slowly changing dimensions to describe different approaches to managing historical changes in dimension tables like CUSTOMER_ADDRESS.

Type 1 Architecture (Retain Changes):
In Type 1 architecture, changes to customer addresses are not retained. Instead, the existing address is overwritten with the new address without preserving any historical information.

Table Structure:
customer_id (Foreign Key)
address
city
state
postal_code

Implications:
Simple to implement and manage.
Efficient storage utilization since only the latest address is retained.
However, historical address information is lost, making it unsuitable for auditing or tracking address changes over time.

Type 2 Architecture (Retain Historical Changes):
In a Type 2 architecture, changes to customer addresses are retained, and historical information is preserved by adding new rows to the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table whenever an address changes. Each row includes a timestamp to indicate when the address was valid.

Table Structure:
customer_id (Foreign Key)
address
city
state
postal_code
start_date
end_date

Implications:
Allows for tracking historical changes in customer addresses.
Enables auditing and analysis of address changes over time.
However, it requires more storage space and complex querying to retrieve historical address information.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
